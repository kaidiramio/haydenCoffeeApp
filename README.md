# Barista POS App
Our team made a point of sales system/ full-stack applciation. A cashier can take a customers order and then the order get sends to a queue where Baristas are able to login and see the pending orders. Once complete Baristas can check off the order and it gets sent to the completed que. Baristas can cancel and order as well in the even that's needed.

## Installation

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB

My learning was focused on continuing to develop a deeper knowledge on express.js. Learning more about CRUD and implemtning a cool random coffee fact generator for the Baristas. 

## Lessons Learned:

I got to practice, on a fundamental level, utilizing express.js. I had some outside challenges this week, so focusing was defintely tougher and I'm working hard to get back to where I'd like to be! My team really helped me and took time to catch me up with some things. Shoutout to my team this week for communicating and throwing resources out for me to work with while I was out.
